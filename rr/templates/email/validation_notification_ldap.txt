Changes have been validated for LDAP client {{ entity_id }}. The necessary
firewall rules and a service account (if required) will be
created/updated in the next update run within a couple of days. If a new
service account will be created, the account information will be sent

If you run into limits or if you need to access any attributes or LDAP groups
but are 100% certain that your LDAP client cannot be configured to use a
service account, please contact atk-ldap@helsinki.fi.
